# WMEFixer

A small script adapted from dummyd2's code to fix WME's latest code breakage.

## Installation

- Click on the script name
- Push the raw button, this should trigger TamperMonkey
- Install the script
- Go to TamperMonkey dashboard
- Find WMEFixer and click
- Go to the settings tab
- Change the position to 1
- Reload WME

## Limitations

This doesn't fix all issues.  Toolbox is currently broken, and having it enabled, with WMEFixer, will result in odd behavior or other scripts just not working at all.

## Acknowledgements

* Hat tip to dummyd2's work on the [original code](https://www.waze.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=819&t=205435&start=10#p1536387) to get past the WME code change hump.
